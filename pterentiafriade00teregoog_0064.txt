Oissue a new edition of such a book as this Latin Gramma!

was in a sense ve1·1tnresome‚for the book es it stood was giving
excellent satisfaction. The hearty welcorne accorded the revision
has shown, however, that a great advance has been made where
improvement was not generally considered possible.

The aim was nothing less than this-to make the grammar os
perfect as suclt a book possibly corr be. The latest conclusione of
souud scholarship are presented, and everything is put in the best
form for use.

Some of the features of the new edition are its constant regard
for the needs of the class-room3 its combiuiug scientific accuraey
with clearness and simplicity of staternent3 the intelligibility and
quotableness ol the rules, secured without concessions to rnechanicel
ways of treating grammar; the addition ol much new matter of
great value3 the marking of all long vowels3 the increase of the
number of illustrative examples; the numerous cross references;
the excellence of the typography3 and the indexes, glossary, list of

' authors, and list ol rules.
In short, “the best has been made better.'’
