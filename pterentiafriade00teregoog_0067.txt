THE text oi this edition is based upon Halm’s edition oi 1882,
but the manuscript reading has been restored in many instancea
and the spelling modified in accordance with the results oi the most
recent studies. In the commentary an effort has been made to
show the development oi prose Latin since Cicer03 but the dis-
tinotive aim has been to present a complete and connected view oi
the reign oi Tiberius, and to trace and explain the successive stages
in the deterioration of his character, from the wisc and humane
ruler of his earlier years to the gloomy and suspicions tyrant with
whom all are familiar: with that end, the break in the narrative,
caused by the loss oi parts of the fifth and sixth Books, has been
filled by citations from Dio Cassius, Suetonius, and other writers.
The important constitutional and administrative changes of this
period receive special attention.

THE plan of the College Series contemplates at present two vol-

umes oi Livy, oue containing Boohs I. and II., the other Books
XXI. and XXII. The first volume, which is now ready, has been
edIted by Professor Greenough in accordance with his well-known
views on the teaching oi Latin. The fact that Livy is commonly
read by ireshmen —that Is, by students who are still engaged in ’
learning to read Latin —has been kept steadily in view. Histori-
cal questions have been treated with sufficient iulness ior intelligent
reading; but the discussion of them has been made subordinate to
the presentation oi Livy's exact ideas in the iorm in which they
lay in his mind, and in the precise order in which in their parts
and their totality he intended to present them. The characteres
early Roman history and Livy's quality as a historiari, together
with his style and Latinity, are treated in the Introduction.
