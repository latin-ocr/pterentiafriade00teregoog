W HILE this book takes due account of the literature which has

grown up about Horace, it is meant to be distinctly a study
of the poet himself, andis intended especially for the college class-
room. The commentary assumes that the reader is at a somewhat
advanced period in his Latin studies. Matters of grammatical
detail occupy therefore a very subordinate placa—except so far
as Horace's Latinity marks an important stage in the development
of the language, or is a conscious deviation for specific purposes
from the ordinary literary usages. On the other hand, the affort
is made to trace the motive and sequence of thought in each dis-
course and letter, and thus to emphasize Horace’s reflections upon
Roman society at one of its great turning-points, and to make clear

the poet's system oi conduct and life.

IN the Brutos, which was composed in 46 nc. and purports to

be a conversation with Atticus and Brutus, Cicero traces the
development of oratory among the Romans down to his own time,
with critical notices oi about two hundred speakers. The long
catalogue is relieved oi dryness by the dialogus form, the freedom
of digression, and by Cicero’s fresh and teeming style.

Professor Kellogg has edited the work especially for college read-
ing. The introductiou touches upon points of interest to those to
whom Cicero is no stranger, and contains a full conspectus. The
notes deal with the subject-matter, historical relations, and diction
of the dialogue rather than with the commonplaces of grammar.
Parallel passages are freely given, especially from Cicero’s other
rhetorical works and from Quintilian.
